# Documentation

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. 

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language. 

## Getting Started

### [Installing Go](/doc/install)

Instructions for downloading and installing Go.

### [Tutorial: Getting started](/doc/tutorial/getting-started.html)

A brief Hello, World tutorial to get started. Learn a bit about Go code, tools, packages, and modules.

### [Tutorial: Create a module](/doc/tutorial/create-module.html)

A tutorial of short topics introducing functions, error handling, arrays, maps, unit testing, and compiling.

### [Tutorial: Getting started with multi-module workspaces](/doc/tutorial/workspaces.html)

Introduces the basics of creating and using multi-module workspaces in Go. Multi-module workspaces are useful for making changes across multiple modules.

Introduces the basics of writing a RESTful web service API with Go and the Gin Web Framework.

### [Tutorial: Getting started with generics](/doc/tutorial/generics.html)

With generics, you can declare and use functions or types that are written to work with any of a set of types provided by calling code.

### [Tutorial: Getting started with fuzzing](/doc/tutorial/fuzz.html)

Fuzzing can generate inputs to your tests that can catch edge cases and security issues that you may have missed.

### [Writing Web Applications](/doc/articles/wiki/)

### [How to write Go code](code.html)

This doc explains how to develop a simple set of Go packages inside a module, and it shows how to use the [`go` command](/cmd/go/) to build and test packages. 

### [A Tour of Go](/tour/)

An interactive introduction to Go in four sections. The first section covers basic syntax and data structures; the second discusses methods and interfaces; the third is about Generics; and the fourth introduces Go's concurrency primitives. Each section concludes with a few exercises so you can practice what you've learned. You can [take the tour online](/tour/) or install it locally with: 
    
    
    	$ go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest
    	
    	  ![](/images/icons/copy-paste.svg)
    	  ![](/images/icons/copy-paste-dark.svg)
    	
    

This will place the `tour` binary in your [GOPATH](/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_and_Modules)'s `bin` directory. 

## Using and understanding Go

## Accessing databases

### [Tutorial: Accessing a relational database](/doc/tutorial/database-access)

Introduces the basics of accessing a relational database using Go and the `database/sql` package in the standard library. 

### [Accessing relational databases](/doc/database/index)

An overview of Go's data access features. 

### [Opening a database handle](/doc/database/open-handle)

You use the Go database handle to execute database operations. Once you open a handle with database connection properties, the handle represents a connection pool it manages on your behalf. 

### [Executing SQL statements that don't return data](/doc/database/change-data)

For SQL operations that might change the database, including SQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, you use `Exec` methods. 

### [Querying for data](/doc/database/querying)

For `SELECT` statements that return data from a query, using the `Query` or `QueryRow` method. 

### [Using prepared statements](/doc/database/prepared-statements)

Defining a prepared statement for repeated use can help your code run a bit faster by avoiding the overhead of re-creating the statement each time your code performs the database operation. 

### [Executing transactions](/doc/database/execute-transactions)

`sql.Tx` exports methods representing transaction-specific semantics, including `Commit` and `Rollback`, as well as methods you use to perform common database operations. 

### [Canceling in-progress database operations](/doc/database/cancel-operations)

Using [context.Context](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context), you can have your application's function calls and services stop working early and return an error when their processing is no longer needed. 

### [Managing connections](/doc/database/manage-connections)

For some advanced programs, you might need to tune connection pool parameters or work with connections explicitly. 

### [Avoiding SQL injection risk](/doc/database/sql-injection)

You can avoid an SQL injection risk by providing SQL parameter values as `sql` package function arguments 

## Developing modules

### [Developing and publishing modules](/doc/modules/developing)

You can collect related packages into modules, then publish the modules for other developers to use. This topic gives an overview of developing and publishing modules. 

### [Module release and versioning workflow](/doc/modules/release-workflow)

When you develop modules for use by other developers, you can follow a workflow that helps ensure a reliable, consistent experience for developers using the module. This topic describes the high-level steps in that workflow. 

### [Managing module source](/doc/modules/managing-source)

When you're developing modules to publish for others to use, you can help ensure that your modules are easier for other developers to use by following the repository conventions described in this topic. 

### [Organizing a Go module](/doc/modules/layout)

What is the right way to organize the files and directories in a typical Go project? This topic discusses some common layouts depending on the kind of module you have. 

### [Developing a major version update](/doc/modules/major-version)

A major version update can be very disruptive to your module's users because it includes breaking changes and represents a new module. Learn more in this topic. 

### [Publishing a module](/doc/modules/publishing)

When you want to make a module available for other developers, you publish it so that it's visible to Go tools. Once you've published the module, developers importing its packages will be able to resolve a dependency on the module by running commands such as `go get`. 

### [Module version numbering](/doc/modules/version-numbers)

A module's developer uses each part of a module's version number to signal the versionâ€™s stability and backward compatibility. For each new release, a module's release version number specifically reflects the nature of the module's changes since the preceding release. 

## Talks

### [A Video Tour of Go](https://research.swtch.com/gotour)

Three things that make Go fast, fun, and productive: interfaces, reflection, and concurrency. Builds a toy web crawler to demonstrate these. 

### [Code that grows with grace](https://vimeo.com/53221560)

One of Go's key design goals is code adaptability; that it should be easy to take a simple design and build upon it in a clean and natural way. In this talk Andrew Gerrand describes a simple "chat roulette" server that matches pairs of incoming TCP connections, and then use Go's concurrency mechanisms, interfaces, and standard library to extend it with a web interface and other features. While the function of the program changes dramatically, Go's flexibility preserves the original design as it grows. 

### [Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs)

Concurrency is the key to designing high performance network services. Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) provide a simple and efficient means of expressing concurrent execution. In this talk we see how tricky concurrency problems can be solved gracefully with simple Go code. 

### [Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw)

This talk expands on the _Go Concurrency Patterns_ talk to dive deeper into Go's concurrency primitives.
