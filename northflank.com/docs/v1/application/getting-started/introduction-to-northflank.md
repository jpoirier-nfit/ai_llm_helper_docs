# Introduction to Northflank

Northflank is the full-stack cloud platform. Seamlessly build, deploy and scale your code, jobs and databases.

Northflank allows you to:

  * Build and deploy code written in any language, using any framework, with a Dockerfile or a buildpack. Simply connect your account on a Git provider such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

  * Automatically build and deploy every commit you make, or you can create rules for specific branches and pull requests.

  * Deploy Docker images from external registries such as Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or GitHub Packages container registry. Save your credentials to easily access private registries.

  * Deploy addon databases & services such as MinIO and RabbitMQ in one click and connect these with your services to create fully stateful applications.

  * Run your code on a schedule or as and when you need to with cron and manual jobs. A job can build and run any code from a repository â€” or use an existing Docker image from a public or private registry.

  * Create team accounts at no extra cost, with all the features of user accounts. Work together seamlessly with the real-time user interface that shows you what your team members are doing. Granular role-based access control means you can securely give your developers access to exactly what they need.

  * Work in real time. All actions, updates and changes are instantly reflected in the user interface, resulting in unparalleled developer experience.

  * Set up dedicated development, staging and production environments with pipelines. When you are happy with a development build, simply promote it to another linked deployment service in the next stage with one click.

  * Save groups of build and runtime variables to inherit in your deployments. Get connection details from addons and create dynamic variables using templating.
