# Observability on Northflank

Northflank provides observability tooling to monitor and ensure your applications and microservices are available.

Logs and metrics

You can view live and historical logs and metrics for builds, deployments, jobs, and addons.

You can configure health checks for deployments and jobs to ensure your applications are available to serve traffic, and that containers can be automatically replaced if they are in an unhealthy state.

You can also integrate external log aggregators to analyze and retain logs from your Northflank workloads.

Organisations can use audit logs to track actions taken on Northflank and ensure compliance.

Alerts and notifications

You can configure infrastructure alerts to monitor usage and be informed of any issues with your resources. These are delivered via a notification integration with other service providers, or via custom webhooks.
