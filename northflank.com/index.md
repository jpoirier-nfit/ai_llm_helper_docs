## Testimonials from Weights and Polyguard

From the front lines

> Northflank helped us scale to over 3M users with an engineering team of two. It allows us to run 10,000 AI training jobs and half a million inference runs per day, without us having to worry about autoscaling or spot instance orchestration. We don’t waste time or money on infrastructure, so we can focus on building product.

## Testimonials from Sentry and Writer

Endorsed by infra veterans

> Northflank is way easier than gluing a bunch of tools together to spin up apps and databases. It’s the ideal platform to deploy containers in our cloud account, avoiding the brain damage of big cloud and Kubernetes. It’s more powerful and flexible than traditional PaaS – all within our VPC. Northflank has become a go-to way to deploy workloads at Sentry.
