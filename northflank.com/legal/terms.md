# Terms of Service

Effective Date: **1 March 2021**

## Agreement to Terms of Services

These Terms of Services (the “Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and Northflank Ltd (“Northflank”, "Company", “we”, “us”, or “our”), concerning your access to and use of the <https://northflank.com/> website and <https://app.northflank.com/> cloud platform as well as any other form, channel, APIs, website or application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Services”). You agree that by accessing the Services, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked “I agree” (or similar), you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms. If you do not agree with all of these Terms, then you are expressly prohibited from using the Services and you must discontinue use immediately.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on our website from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms at any time and for any reason, such as to reflect changes in applicable law or updates to the Services or functionality. The most current version will always be posted on our website. If an amendment is material, as determined in our sole discretion, we will notify you by email. Changes will be effective no sooner than the day that they are publicly posted. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Terms are posted. If you do not want to agree to any changes made to the Terms, you must immediately stop using the Services. The Services are not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

The Services are intended for users who are at least 16 years of age. Persons under the age of 16 are not permitted to use the Services or create an account.

Any words in these Terms following the terms “including”, “include”, “in particular”, “such as”, “for example” or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those terms.

## Intellectual Property Rights

Unless otherwise indicated, the Services are our proprietary property and all source code, databases, functionality, software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Services (collectively, the “Content”) and the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the “Marks”) are owned or controlled by us or licensed to us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and laws of the United Kingdom, international copyright laws, and international conventions. The Content and the Marks are provided on the Services “AS IS” for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, no part of the Services and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, distributed, sold, licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written permission.

Provided that you are eligible to use the Services and subject to these Terms, you are granted a non-exclusive limited license to access and use the Services and to download or print a copy of any portion of the Content to which you have properly gained access solely for your personal, non-commercial use. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you in and to the Service, the Content and the Marks.

## User Representations

By using the Services, you represent and warrant that: (1) all registration information you submit will be true, accurate, current, and complete; (2) you will maintain the accuracy of such information and promptly update such registration information as necessary; (3) you have the legal capacity and you agree to comply with these Terms; (4) you are not a minor in the jurisdiction of your country of residence; (5) you will not access the Services through automated or non-human means, whether through a bot, script or otherwise, unless such means provided by Northflank (such as using Northflank APIs); (6) you will not use the Services for any illegal or unauthorised purpose (such as hosting illegal content); and (7) your use of the Services will not violate any applicable laws or regulations.

If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any portion thereof).

## User Registration

You are required to create an account to access the services and functionalities of Northflank. We may maintain different account types for individual users and teams. If you open an account on behalf of a company, organisation or other entity (for example by signing up with your company email address), you then represent and warrant that you are an authorised representative of such entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and you agree to these Terms of the entity’s behalf.

You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorised use of your account. We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.

You can control your account settings by logging into your account. By providing us with your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you notices and communication related to the Services, including any notices required by law.

## Fees and Payment

You may be required to purchase or pay a fee to access some of our Services. You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases and subscriptions made for our Services. You further agree to promptly update your account and payment information, including email address, payment method, and payment card expiration date, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed.

We will bill you through a third party payment service Stripe, unless otherwise mutually agreed. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Services Agreement available at <https://stripe.com/legal>.

Sales tax will be added to the price of purchases as deemed required by us. We may change prices at any time. All payments shall be in US dollars, unless stated otherwise.

Our pricing is displayed on <https://northflank.com/pricing> (“Pricing Page”). We will charge you for how you configure and consume your services, applications, jobs, add-ons, instances, regions and any other aspects related to the Services provided by us (collectively, “Resources”) as displayed on the Pricing Page and when you configure them. You can monitor your spending and view your invoices by logging into your account and navigating to Account Billing.

You agree to pay all charges or fees at the prices then in effect for your purchases, and you authorise us to charge your chosen payment method for any such amounts automatically. You consent to our charging your payment method any outstanding amount you owe us automatically, without requiring your prior approval for each charge.

If we cannot automatically charge your default payment method, we may attempt to charge other payment methods on your account. If we fail to charge you multiple times, we reserve the right to stop the Services for you and prevent your account from future purchases. Any money owed to us must be paid in full.

To protect both you and us, we may introduce limits on your spending. We will always notify you via email of any limits applied to your account.

We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in billing, even if we have already requested or received payment. We also reserve the right to refuse you to increase or use the Resources. All purchases and Resources consumptions are non-refundable.

## Third-Party Service Providers

As part of the functionality of the Services, you may link your account with online account you have with third-party service providers (each such account, a “Third-Party Account”) by either: (1) providing your Third-Party Account login information through the Services; or (2) allowing us to access your Third-Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account. Such Third-Party Accounts may include GitHub (<https://github.com/>), GitLab (<https://gitlab.com>), BitBucket (<https://bitbucket.org/>) or Google (<https://google.com>).

You represent and warrant that you are entitled to disclose your Third-Party Account login information to us and/or grant us access to your Third-Party Account, without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third-Party Account, and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by the third-party service provider of the Third-Party Account. By granting us access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) we may access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (the “Social Network Content”) so that it is available on and through the Services via your account, including without limitation any repositories and (2) we may submit to and receive from your Third-Party Account additional information to the extent you are notified when you link your account with the Third-Party Account. Depending on the Third-Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be available on and through your account on the Services. Please note that if a Third-Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or our access to such Third-Party Account is terminated by the third-party service provider, then the Social Network Content may no longer be available on and through the Services. You will have the ability to disable the connection between your account on the Services and your Third-Party Accounts at any time. Please note that your relationship with the Third-Party Service Providers associated with your Third-Party Accounts is governed solely by your agreement(s) with such Third-Party Service Providers.

We make no effort to review any Social Network Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality, or non-infringement, and we are not responsible for any Social Network Content. You can deactivate the connection between the Services and your Third-Party Account by contacting us using the contact information below or through your account settings. We will attempt to delete any information stored on our servers that was obtained through such Third-Party Account, except the username and profile picture that may become associated with your account.

Our Services interoperate with a range of third party service features. We do not make any warranty or representation on the availability of those features. Without limiting the previous sentence, if a third party feature provider ceases to provide that feature or ceases to make that feature available on reasonable terms, we may cease to make that feature available to you. To avoid doubt, if we exercise our right to cease the availability of a third party feature, you are not entitled to any refund, discount or other compensation.

## Third-Party Websites and Content

The Services may contain (or you may be sent via the Services) links to other websites ("Third-Party Websites") as well as articles, photographs, text, graphics, pictures, designs, music, sound, video, information, applications, software, and other content or items belonging to or originating from third parties ("Third-Party Content"). Such Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Content are not investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for any Third-Party Websites accessed through the Services or any Third-Party Content posted on, available through, or installed from the Services, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices, or other policies of or contained in the Third-Party Websites or the Third-Party Content. Inclusion of, linking to, or permitting the use or installation of any Third-Party Websites or any Third-Party Content does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by us. If you decide to leave the Services and access the Third-Party Websites or to use or install any Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk, and you should be aware these Terms no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any website to which you navigate from the Services or relating to any applications you use or install from the Services. Any purchases you make through Third-Party Websites will be through other websites and from other companies, and we take no responsibility whatsoever in relation to such purchases which are exclusively between you and the applicable third party. You agree and acknowledge that we do not endorse the products or services offered on Third-Party Websites and you shall hold us harmless from any harm caused by your purchase of such products or services. Additionally, you shall hold us harmless from any losses sustained by you or harm caused to you relating to or resulting in any way from any Third-Party Content or any contact with Third-Party Websites.

## Submissions

You acknowledge and agree that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback, or other information regarding the Services ("Submissions") provided by you to us are non-confidential and shall become our sole property. We shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any lawful purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. You hereby waive all moral rights to any such Submissions, and you hereby warrant that any such Submissions are original with you or that you have the right to submit such Submissions. You agree there shall be no recourse against us for any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of any proprietary right in your Submissions.

## U.S. Government Rights

Our services are “commercial items” as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101. If our services are acquired by or on behalf of any agency not within the Department of Defense (“DOD”), our services are subject to the terms of these Terms in accordance with FAR 12.212 (for computer software) and FAR 12.211 (for technical data). If our services are acquired by or on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense, our services are subject to the terms of these Terms in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (“DFARS”) 227.7202‑3. In addition, DFARS 252.227‑7015 applies to technical data acquired by the DOD. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software or technical data under these Terms.

## Service Management

We reserve the right, but not the obligation, to: (1) monitor the Services for violations of these Terms; (2) take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates the law or these Terms, including without limitation, reporting such user to law enforcement authorities; (3) in our sole discretion and without limitation, refuse, restrict access to, limit the availability of, or disable (to the extent technologically feasible) any of your Contributions or any portion thereof; (4) in our sole discretion and without limitation, notice, or liability, to remove from the Services or otherwise disable all files and content that are excessive in size or are in any way burdensome to our systems; and (5) otherwise manage the Services in a manner designed to protect our rights and property and to facilitate the proper functioning of the Services.

## Privacy Policy

We care about data privacy and security. Our Privacy Policy is available on <https://northflank.com/legal/privacy>. By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms. Our Services are hosted in the United Kingdom. If you access the Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United Kingdom, then through your continued use of the Services, you are transferring your data to the United Kingdom, and you agree to have your data transferred to and processed in the United Kingdom.

## Term and Termination

These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, we reserve the right to, in our sole discretion and without notice or liability, deny access to and use of the Services (including blocking certain IP addresses), to any person for any reason or for no reason, including without limitation for breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in these Terms or of any applicable law or regulation. We may terminate your use or participation in the Services or delete your account and any content or information that you posted at any time, without warning, in our sole discretion.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

## Modifications and Interruptions

We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Services at any time or for any reason at our sole discretion without notice. However, we have no obligation to update any information on our Services. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue all or part of the Services without notice at any time. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.

We cannot guarantee the Services will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Services at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Services during any downtime or discontinuance of the Services. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Services or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make our Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime. We expect planned downtime to be infrequent but will endeavor to provide you with advanced notice, if we think it may exceed ten (10) continuous minutes.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and interpreted following the laws of the United Kingdom, and the use of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If your habitual residence is in the EU, and you are a consumer, you additionally possess the protection provided to you by obligatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. Northflank and yourself both agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales, which means that you may make a claim to defend your consumer protection rights in regards to these Terms in the United Kingdom, or in the EU country in which you reside.

## Dispute resolution

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

### Binding Arbitration

Any dispute arising from the relationships between the Parties to this contract shall be determined by one arbitrator who will be chosen in accordance with the Arbitration and Internal Rules of the European Court of Arbitration being part of the European Centre of Arbitration having its seat in Strasbourg, and which are in force at the time the application for arbitration is filed, and of which adoption of this clause constitutes acceptance. The seat of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The language of the proceedings shall be English. Applicable rules of substantive law shall be the law of the United Kingdom.

### Restrictions

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

### Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

### Corrections

There may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the Services at any time, without prior notice.

### Disclaimer

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, in connection with the Services and your use thereof, including, without limitation, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

As with the purchase of a product or service through any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and exercise caution where appropriate.

## Limitations of Liability

In no event will we or our directors, employees, or agents be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages, including lost profit, lost revenue, loss of data, or other damages arising from your use of the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, our liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all time be limited to the lesser of the amount paid, if any, by you to us or $100.00 USD. Certain US state laws and international laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights.

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of our respective officers, agents, partners, and employees, from and against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (1) use of the Services; (2) breach of these Terms; (3) any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms; (4) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; or (5) any overt harmful act toward any other user of the Services with whom you connected via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of such claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.

We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against us by virtue having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.
